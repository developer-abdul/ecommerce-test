# Project Progress Summary

This is what I did.

First I read your requirement.

Understood it.

I then thought of using the React + Next.js framework, as it meets the requirements effectively.

Since this is related to E-Commerce, the framework offers built-in optimization and a TypeScript structure.

So the next step was setting up Ant Design, as it was mentioned in the email that using it would be a plus.

After that, I started working on the UI designs. The key screens included:
1. Login screen
2. Dashboard screen
3. Products screen
4. Single Product screen
  
I then worked on implementing the authentication functionality.

I have made clear and descriptive commits for easy reference.
